## Morty revolutionizing the Mortgage Industry
### Overview and Origin
#### Morty is an online, full-service mortgage broker that provides a simplified solution for mortgage processing by offering tools that enable customers to explore, compare loan options, and close mortgage with a lender completely online. This digitized solution matches the customer with the right loan product, providing a simple, modern and transparent experience.

#### Adam Rothblatt, Brian Faux, Sarah Thomas and Nora Apsel cofounded Morty in 2016, with the intent to bring mortgage service online, make them more transparent and promote customer experience. On the platform customers can access over 20 lenders, and the overall closing completed in a considerably shorter period compared to the Traditional application process.

#### Funding and investment metrics published as at July 14th 2021 are as follows:
	- Total Funding Amount: $36.5M
	- Latest Financing Type: Series B
	- Funding Rounds: 5
	- Number of investors: 6
    - Post money valuation: $100M - $500M

### Why this Matters
#### With this digital transformation customers can receive a home financing score, real-time loan pricing, calculate how much they are eligible for, choose from a variety of lenders and close on a mortgage. Every part of the process works digitally with little or no human intervention, and no paper trail, loan officer, or a closing agent.

####  Some of the Key Challenges faced with Traditional mortgage financing are: 
	- A large percentage of buyers end up applying with a single lender or broker, without shopping around for a competitive deal or option
	- Most buyers accept the first mortgage offer they receive, thereby losing out on the opportunity to save money by comparing different loan options.
    - Lots of paperwork, bank visits and lack of transparency on the end-to -end process makes the process extremely complex and difficult.

### Customer Demographics,  Technology Solution and Competitive edge 
#### Current data reflects that thousands of homeowners have registered with Morty and there has been over 100% growth year over year. Presently top users of this service are within the 30 through to 50 years age range looking to explore the competitive price options offered by the different lenders on the platform.

#### Key Technology solutions leverged by Morty to ensure that they are competitive in the market are as follows: 
	- Morty leverages Artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), Analytics and Mortgage Analytics.
	- Individual mortgage guidelines from a range of lenders are automatically uploaded into the database and as the prospective buyer enter their financial information and detail, the algorithm determines which offer best suites the prospect.
	- Same model as above is applied in comparing loans.
	- Daily Iterative changes are factored into the algorithm, which provide appropriate matching of users to the different options.
	- While some banks and mortgage providers offers some level of digital innovation without completely eliminating traditional process, Morty provides an end-to-end digital process and mobile first experience.
    - In addition to the automated solution, Morty also has in-house mortgage loan experts, and provides personalized service, hence offering prospective buyers the right balance of technology and human interaction.
